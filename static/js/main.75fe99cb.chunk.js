Occupied a large proportion of development resources, developing icons can be a time-consuming task, because developers need to consider not only effective implementation methods but also easy-to-understand descriptions. In this study, we define 100 icon classes through an iterative open coding for the existing icon design sharing website. Based on a deep learning model and computer vision methods, we propose an approach to automatically convert icon images to fonts with descriptive labels, thereby reducing the laborious manual effort for developers and facilitating UI development. We quantitatively evaluate the quality of our method in the real world UI development environment and demonstrate that our method offers developers accurate, efficient, readable, and usable code for icon images, in terms of saving 65.2 \u2026',category:{type:"BOOK",categoryTitle:"26th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces",issue:"",volume:"",pages:"56-69",publisher:""},link:"thislinkisfakedonteventrytoclickit.okay",authors:["Sidong Feng","Suyu Ma","Jinzhong Yu","Chunyang Chen","TingTing Zhou","Yankun Zhen"],yearPublished:"2021"},{_id:"fake_publication_2",title:"Context-aware Personalized Crowdtesting Task Recommendation",description:"Crowdsourced software testing (short for crowdtesting) is a special type of crowdsourcing. It requires that crowdworkers master appropriate skill-sets and commit significant effort for completing a task. Abundant uncertainty may arise during a crowdtesting process due to imperfect information between the task requester and crowdworkers. For example, a worker frequently chooses tasks in an ad hoc manner in crowdtesting context, and an inappropriate task selection may lead to the worker's failing to detect any bugs, and significant testing effort unpaid and wasted. Recent studies have explored methods for supporting task requesters to make informed decisions on task pricing, worker recommendation, and so on. Unfortunately, very few study offers decision making support from the crowdworkers' perspectives.

Patients with symptomatic leg SVT of at least 5\u2009cm length were randomized to 45 days of rivaroxaban 10\u2009mg daily or to placebo, and followed for a total of 90 days. Treatment failure (required a nonstudy anticoagulant; had proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; or had surgery for SVT) at 90 days was the primary efficacy outcome. Secondary efficacy outcomes included leg pain severity, and venous disease-specific and general health-related quality of life over 90 days. Major bleeding at 90 days was the primary safety outcome. Poor enrollment led to the trial being stopped after 85 of the planned 600 patients were randomized to rivaroxaban (n\u2009=\u200943) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200942).
